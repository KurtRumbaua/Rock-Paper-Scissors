# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with JavaScript.

## Project Overview

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, which provides a free, open-source full-stack web development course. This implementation focuses on core JavaScript concepts and logic without any fancy UI (yet).

## How It Works

The game consists of 5 rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer:

1. The player is prompted to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors (using numbers 1-3)
2. The computer randomly selects its choice
3. The winner of each round is determined using classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Paper beats Rock
   - Scissors beats Paper
4. After all 5 rounds, the final winner is announced along with the score breakdown

## Key Features

- Random computer choice generation
- User-friendly prompts for player input
- Score tracking and final results display
- Implementation of game logic using JavaScript objects for winning conditions
- Console feedback after each round

## Skills Demonstrated

- JavaScript fundamentals
- Functions and scope
- Conditional logic
- Arrays and objects
- Template literals
- Basic user input handling

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)
4. Follow the prompts to play the game

## Future Improvements

- Add a graphical user interface with buttons
- Implement better input validation
- Add game history tracking
- Add the ability to play again without refreshing
